#Coda 2 Themes | TextMate like theme ports.
 I'm not the creator or originator of the original themes, I'm just porting over more common themes from TextMate to give Coda 2 users more flavor of themes. 

Justin Hileman has a nice collection of ported themes not include in my pack (no need for dublication):  [Justin's Coda 2 themes](http://justinhileman.info/coda-colors/).

If you have any themes you'd like ported, you can ticket them or even faster tweet me your request: [@iPaintCode](http://twitter.com/iPaintCode/).
