#Coda 2 Themes | TextMate like theme ports by iPaintCode ([Mark Learst](http://iPaintCode.com/)).

  I'm not the creator or originator of the original themes, I'm just porting over more common themes from TextMate to give Coda 2 users more flavor of themes. 

Justin Hileman has a nice collection of ported themes not include in my pack (no need for dublication):  [More Code 2 themes](http://justinhileman.info/coda-colors/).

##Version 0.1
###Amy, Blackboard, Cobalt, Espresso Libra, Lowlight, Mac Classic, Notebook, Pastels on Dark, PlasticCodeWrap, Railscast, SpaceCadet, Sunburst, Twilight, Zenburnesque

##Themes
A collection of common TextEditor themes ported to the new Coda 2

##Usage
Download zip and double clip the XXX.sss themes, goto the Preferences inside
Coda 2 and select the Color tab. Use the Style Sheet dropdown to select the new
theme just installed.
